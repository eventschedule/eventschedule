    <title>Self-Host Terms - Event Schedule</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Self-hosting Event Schedule</h1>
    <p>All features from the hosted app are included in the open-source code. By self-hosting Event Schedule, you accept the platform "as is" and "with all faults," assuming all risks associated with running and maintaining your own instance. Use of the source code is governed by the <strong>Attribution Assurance License</strong>; these Terms govern your relationship with Event Schedule as a service and support provider.</p>

    <h2>Data Ownership & Access</h2>
    <p>Self-hosters own their data and bear full responsibility for it. <strong>Event Schedule cannot access, modify, or remove self-hosted data</strong> stored on your private infrastructure. Users must handle any losses or damages affecting their clients independently.</p>

    <h2>Amendment Rights</h2>
    <p>Event Schedule may modify these terms regarding support, connected services, and future releases with notice via email, dashboards, or websites. Changes become binding seven days after notice, unless longer periods apply by law. While the open-source license for a specific version of the code is permanent, users must accept updated Terms to continue receiving official updates or technical support.</p>

    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
    <p>Users must be 18 years of age or older and confirm compliance with applicable laws. Prior suspension or removal from Event Schedule services disqualifies new access to our official support and update channels.</p>

    <h2>Personal Responsibility</h2>
    <p>Users are responsible for securing their credentials and handling all legal obligations regarding data privacy, copyright, and international regulations independently.</p>

    <h2>Your Obligations</h2>
    <p>Users remain solely responsible for goods, services, and customer obligations facilitated through the platform.</p>

    <h2>Customer Service</h2>
    <p>Users provide their own customer support. Event Schedule only assists account users with platform functionality on the hosted version or via specific enterprise support agreements.</p>

    <h2>Data Use & Privacy</h2>
    <p>For self-hosted instances, <strong>this section applies only to data explicitly transmitted to Event Schedule</strong> (e.g., via opted-in crash reports, update checks, or cloud-relay features). In such cases, you grant Event Schedule a non-exclusive, fully sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-free right to use, copy, and store that specific data solely for the purpose of providing services to your instance.</p>

    <h2>Restricted Businesses & Sanctions</h2>
    <p>Illegal activities and use in high-risk jurisdictions (Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Crimea, Syria) are prohibited. While the software is open source, Event Schedule does not provide support or services to prohibited categories, including gambling, telemarketing, unauthorized multi-level marketing, or weapons sales.</p>

    <h2>Indemnity & Liability</h2>
    <p>Users indemnify Event Schedule against claims arising from platform use, agreement violations, or third-party rights infringement. Event Schedule disclaims liability for damages, lost profits, or data loss, as further detailed in the Attribution Assurance License.</p>
