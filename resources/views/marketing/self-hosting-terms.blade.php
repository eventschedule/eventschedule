                    All features from the hosted app are included in the open-source code. By self-hosting Event Schedule, you accept the platform "as is" and "with all faults," assuming all risks associated with running and maintaining your own instance. Use of the source code is governed by the <strong>Attribution Assurance License</strong>; these Terms govern your relationship with Event Schedule as a service and support provider.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Data Ownership & Access</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                    Self-hosters own their data and bear full responsibility for it. <strong>Event Schedule cannot access, modify, or remove self-hosted data</strong> stored on your private infrastructure. Users must handle any losses or damages affecting their clients independently.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Amendment Rights</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                    Event Schedule may modify these terms regarding support, connected services, and future releases with notice via email, dashboards, or websites. Changes become binding seven days after notice, unless longer periods apply by law. While the open-source license for a specific version of the code is permanent, users must accept updated Terms to continue receiving official updates or technical support.
                </p>

                    Users must be 18 years of age or older and confirm compliance with applicable laws. Prior suspension or removal from Event Schedule services disqualifies new access to our official support and update channels.

                    For self-hosted instances, <strong>this section applies only to data explicitly transmitted to Event Schedule</strong> (e.g., via opted-in crash reports, update checks, or cloud-relay features).
